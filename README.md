# Hearth

Hearth is a Home Assistant dashboard for wall tablets, phones and desktops. It brings your rooms, devices and daily information into a configurable interface with a visual editor, responsive layouts and day/night themes.

Hearth is an early-stage project and is actively evolving.

## About this fork

This is [Will Adams-Keane](https://github.com/willadamskeane)'s fork of [knowald/ha-hearth](https://github.com/knowald/ha-hearth). It exists to run Hearth well on a real wall tablet: a Lenovo ThinkSmart View, an Android 8 device with Chrome 138, that sits in a study, runs Hearth in the Kiosk Satellite app through Home Assistant Ingress, and doubles as a [Voice Satellite](https://github.com/jxlarrea/voice-satellite-card-integration). Stock Hearth struggled on that hardware in four ways: authentication inside Ingress, rendering cost on a slow GPU, a layout meant for wider screens, and touch handling on a scrolling wall of light tiles. The changes below were developed and checked on that device.

It branched from upstream 0.1.0 on 2026-09-20. Its releases, 0.1.1 to 0.1.20, are numbered separately from upstream, which has since reached 0.3.0 with its own changes that aren't merged here. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list.

### What's different

**Home Assistant Ingress and kiosk access** (0.1.1–0.1.8)

- Reuses the authenticated Home Assistant frontend session inside Ingress, avoiding the OAuth redirect Home Assistant rejects in the Ingress iframe, and derives the browser-facing URL from trusted Ingress headers. The Supervisor hostname stays on the server.
- Adds an IP-restricted direct route for kiosk tablets. Its server-side WebSocket and HTTP proxy authenticate to Home Assistant without exposing the Supervisor credential to the browser. It pairs with the fork's [add-on](https://github.com/willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth).
- Hides Home Assistant's panel title bar in Ingress and keeps Voice Satellite and wake-word handling working when Kiosk Satellite rewrites the browser route.

**Performance on low-end tablets** (0.1.4, 0.1.15–0.1.17)

- Adds an automatic low-power mode that drops backdrop blurs, animated shadows and other expensive compositor effects on weak devices, while keeping the full look on capable ones.
- Subscribes only to the entities a dashboard shows, instead of every entity in the house. It widens back to everything while editing or searching. On the test house this removed about 85% of idle script time.
- Pages open faster. Columns build their first cards before the first frame, SortableJS loads only in edit mode, `Intl` formatters are cached, and light and cover tiles render directly. On the ThinkSmart View, long tasks while switching pages dropped by about half.
- Adds an opt-in performance overlay (`perf_overlay: true` or `?perf=1`), plus a kiosk benchmark and a local profiler under `scripts/kiosk-bench/`. They replay a captured house against a fake Home Assistant and never change real entity state.

**Narrow and tablet layout** (0.1.10–0.1.14)

- On narrow screens the rail's glanceable widgets (clock, date, energy and so on) sit in a compact status strip at the top of the page, not at the bottom of every page.
- The room header is compact, and the edit toggle lives in the status strip instead of floating over page content.

**Touch that doesn't fight scrolling** (0.1.18)

- Light tiles act only on a real tap, meaning one that stays within 10 px in both directions and that the browser doesn't treat as a scroll. A touch that lands while the page is scrolling, or within 300 ms after, presses nothing, and touch ripples wait a moment so tiles don't flash under a passing finger. Mouse and keyboard behave as before.

**Cameras** (0.1.19–0.1.20)

- The camera card accepts several cameras (`entities: [...]`) and shows them as a two-column grid of named snapshots. Tapping one opens its live view.

**Smaller fixes**

- The energy reading is scaled to kWh (Wh sensors previously read as `7234.0 kWh`), and contact sensors read Open/Closed instead of On/Off.

## Home Assistant add-on

On Home Assistant OS or Supervised, install Hearth from its add-on repository:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwilladamskeane%2Faddon-ha-hearth)

To add it by hand, open Settings, Add-ons, Add-on Store, then Repositories from the overflow menu, and paste `https://github.com/willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth`. Install "Hearth (Will's fork)" from the store once the repository is listed. For upstream Hearth, use [knowald/addon-ha-hearth](https://github.com/knowald/addon-ha-hearth) instead.

The add-on appears in the sidebar and is served over Ingress. Set a port in its configuration to expose it directly as well, which is what wall tablets should use. Dashboard configuration is stored on the add-on's own volume and survives updates.

The packaging for this fork lives in [willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth](https://github.com/willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth). Each add-on version builds the tag of the same name from this repository.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer and pnpm 10 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/willadamskeane/ha-hearth.git
cd ha-hearth
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

Set `HASS_URL` in `.env` to your Home Assistant URL, then open the address printed by Vite. Sign in through Home Assistant. The companion app can use a long-lived access token created in your Home Assistant profile.

For a production Node deployment:

```sh
pnpm build
HASS_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 PORT=5050 node server.js
```

The first connection opens a setup wizard that proposes a dashboard using Home Assistant's areas, devices and entities. You can also start with an empty page and add cards and rail widgets yourself.

## Docker

Build and run the project from this checkout:

```sh
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
# Set HASS_URL in .env.docker before starting.
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up -d --build
```

The container listens on port 5050 and stores configuration under `/app/data`. Compose mounts `./data` by default; `DATA_PATH` changes that location. Use `docker compose logs` to inspect server logs.

The publishing workflow targets `ghcr.io/<repository owner>/ha-hearth` (`ghcr.io/willadamskeane/ha-hearth` for this fork) when a release is published. Local builds do not depend on an image already existing in the registry.

## Configuration

- `data/hearth.yaml`: pages, cards, rail widgets, themes and tablet settings.
- `data/configuration.yaml`: language, motion, touch feedback, optional access token and custom JavaScript setting.
- `data/hearth-themes/`: saved Hearth theme presets.
- `data/backups/`: the ten most recent revisions of each saved configuration document.

Persisted dashboard documents declare `version: 5`. Other versions are rejected with a visible load error; they are not automatically converted. A failed load locks dashboard editing to protect the source file. Save requests must include the revision that the client loaded. Conflicts require an explicit choice in the editor.

Custom CSS and opt-in JavaScript are available through application settings. Use `--h-*` tokens for styling. Keep the data directory private: it may contain an access token. Serve Hearth behind your trusted network or authenticated reverse proxy; it does not provide a separate user authentication system for configuration endpoints.

## Interface

Hearth is served at `/`. `?room=<id>` opens a page, `?theme=<preset>` previews a built-in theme and `?menu=false` hides the edit button. These are presentation options, not access controls.

Cards cover entities, headers, sensors, media, vacuums, cameras, images, climate, scenes, elapsed days and conditional media. Rail widgets include clocks, weather, navigation, search, energy, progress, calendars, status, entities, charts, templates, timers, notifications and web pages.

Camera playback supports HLS and WebRTC with a still-image fallback. Calendar widgets show upcoming events. Entity domains without specialized controls use a generic state, attributes and history sheet. Picture-elements editing, calendar editing, todo editing and GPS maps are outside the current feature set.

Touch feedback is off by default and vibrates on presses, long presses, slider steps, saves and failed commands. It needs both a browser that implements the Vibration API and a secure origin: Chrome on Android over https or localhost works, and the same page over plain http does not vibrate at all even though the call reports success. Firefox for Android does not provide the API. iOS Safari 18 has no Vibration API either and is driven through a switch toggle instead, which the browser only honors during the gesture that triggered it.

## Development

```sh
pnpm check
pnpm lint
pnpm check:boundaries
pnpm check:style
pnpm check:hearth-a11y
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm check:bundle
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm matrix
```

Browser tests use a fake Home Assistant and fixture data. `pnpm matrix` generates screenshots and a review sheet. Actual device and live camera behavior also need testing against your installation.
